## Introduction

This document defines a standard, the Public Invention Respiratory Control Standard (PIRCS). The purpose of the PIRCS is to address the COVID-19 pandemic and more generally Composable Ventilator Systems by allowing the engineering community to design, test, manufacture and deploy a clinically effective, supply-chain resilient pandemic ventilation system.

The fundamental purpose of the PIRCS standard is to allow the “air drive” -- the piece which drives air and medical gases into the patient’s lungs -- in carefully controlled ways to be considered a module of a ventilation system in which different air drives could be used interchangeably. The goal is to separate the problem of producing carefully controlled pressure-drive air/oxygen mixtures from the other important problems in a functioning ventilator, such as user control, monitoring, alarming, air heating and humidification, and sanitization/treatment of exhaled air.

Because this is a global problem and because the global supply chain is distressed and clinical needs are evolving, there will not be one solution to the problem of supplying pandemic ventilators. We go further and assert there should not even be pandemic ventilators, but rather there should be pandemic ventilation systems. If you cannot obtain one kind of air source, you should be able to use a different kind of air source without retraining or changing the user display and control mechanism. Although other modularity potentially exists, this standard only encapsulates the “air drive” module. For example, a sister standard already in use, the Public Invention Respiratory Data Standard (PIRDS), is used for the testing/monitoring/alarming piece.

## The General Problem

As of April 24th, there are at least 75 teams working on building ventilators. They use fans, pumps, pressure regulators, and AmbuBags as basic drive mechanisms. Each of these systems have engineering, usage, and economic tradeoffs. The globe needs multiple solutions in each category.
The doctors and patients do not care how the air pushed. They only care that it is done in a reliable, controlled, and controllable manner. With a standard for controlling air drives and sufficient verification and quality control, we can  even imagine an AmuBag drive being unplugged and replaced with, for example, a pump, while the machine is paused for a few seconds without disturbing the patient or requiring resetting the control system or retraining the health care providers.

The fundamental problem requirement is to deliver air at a certain oxygen fraction within pressure limits of sufficient volume and at a sufficient rate, overcoming the compliance and resistance of the diseased lungs. This is expressed in a variety of ventilation modes. A useful air drive need not support all ventilation modes, but it must always deliver air within limits set by a clinician, within a small amount of error.

Because this must be controllable, this is both a data standard and an electrical standard. Systems which claim to conform to this standard must be plug-compatible with a system that controls them. Such a system should also be plug-compatible with a test machine which will control and evaluate the air drive over a long period of time. The standard thus facilitates the difficult problem of testing any proposed air drive sufficiently for clinicians and approval agencies to gain confidence in it.

## The Standard

An Air Drive will present an I2C or SPI electrical interface with a 4-pin JST or Molex-style connector. (size TBD.)
An Air Drive must clearly state what voltage level its outside interface operates at (5V, 3.3V, 1.8V or other.) 
The non-communication electrical power needed by the Air Drive is not a part of this standard.

## Event based protocol

PIRCS data is a series of events. It has no headers, though some events provide meta-information and may be grouped
together to form a header.

When possible, we follow the principle of making data human-readable if possible. In particular, because this
is meant in part for medical professionals, some unit types are chosen to conform that field.

The protocol defines an "acknowledgement" as a particular kind of message which acknowledges the request by echoing
the same data with two additional fields: An error number (zero if no error) and an status character. The protocol
does not state how the acknowledgemnt is to be tranported, but a preferred embodiment is using the same mechanism
by which the PIRCS command was transported in duplex. This will probably a serial port, but it could be an SPI communication
or some other means.

##  Control Command

The most common PIRCS data are command control events.

Commands are defined with 3 bytes [Setting, Interpretation, Value] with each byte followed by a 32-bit signed integer representing the value of each command. Where necessary, the value is multiplied by a decimal to allow an integer to express the acceptable range.

Integers are stored in "Big-Endian" byte order within their 4 bytes.

The parameters are:

1. M : Mode set as a char value listed below
2. P : Target Pressure, cm H2O (a medical standard) times 10
4. E : PEEP Pressure, cm H20
3. V : Target Volume in milliliters
4. F : Target Flow rate, milliliters per second
5. B : Breaths per minute times 10
6. I : E:I Ratio, times 10 (NOTE: I:E ratio is typical, but this standard uses E:I!)
7. O : Oxygen FiO2, % times 10
8. S : Emergency Stop (TBD)
9. A : Alarm Control (TBD)

The interpretations are:

1. m : Minimum
2. M : Maximum
3. T : Target

### Modes

For the mode type, the third byte is the Ventilation Mode byte. There are a wide variety of ventilation modes and names are not entirely standardized. This document is the beginning of a particular standardization of the most common and easy to implement modes. The following modes are defined as part of the standard:

1. “C” - CPAP mode. The drive applies the pressure defined in the maximum/plateau pressure byte (byte 3) continuously. (Note: This mode can be used for testing compliance in certain useful but artificial (non-clinical) situations.)
1. “B” - BiPAP mode. The drive applies the maximum/plateau pressure for the inhalation phase, and at the PEEP pressure for exhalation. (Note: a more advanced mode will allow spontaneous breathing and volume control).
1. “V” -- Pressure Regulated Volume controlled ventilation. Within pressure limits, the machine provides the specified tidal volume with each breath.
1. “S” -- Spontaneous Breathing Mode. The drive pauses after the exhalation period waiting to receive an initiation command, but in all cases will begin a breath within the specified number of seconds. If the maximum number of seconds is 255, a mandatory breath is not required only patient-triggered breaths are required.
1. “P” -- Pressure Support Mode: patient initiates breaths, but pressure is automatically maintained at the set pressure level.
1. “A” -- Pressure Assist Mode: (Note: I’m not sure what the difference between this and “P” is.)
1. “I” - SIMV mode.
1. Modes equal to and above 128 are defined by the drive.

### Control Command

# JSON Expression

Although driven by a need for a byte-level protocol to communicate electronically, there is
also need for a JSON-level expression of the standard. The obvious approach is to define
an event as a JSON object. We hope to make it somewhat human readable, but maintain a
direct connection to the Byte Level expression of the PIRCS standard.

Our expression will use JSON objects with slightly more information names. The character
codes will be used as is. The values will use the same
scale as defined in the byte level specifications. This means that no floating point number will
at present ever appear in a value field.

So for example, to set the target pressure to 40.0 cmH20:

```JavaScript
{ "com": "C",
  "par" : "P",
  "int" : "T",
  "mod" : 0,
  "val" : 400
  }
```

# Acknowledgements

Because we do not want to force microcontrolllers to fully implement JSON, we stick to the simplest possible
JSON compatible embodiment, and add two fields to form an acknowledgement that directly copies the data sent.
Thus the acknowledgement for the command above is:
```JavaScript
{ "ack": "S",
  "err": 0,
  "com": "C",
  "par" : "P",
  "int" : "T",
  "mod" : 0,
  "val" : 400
  }
```
1. The "ack" or acknowledgment field is a single character "S" for successful reception and execution. If the ack field 
is anything other than "S", the means something went wrong. Specific meanings may be added later or remain
implementation-specific will still conforming to this standard.
1. The "err" field contains a 32-bit unsigned integer value of meaning unspecified by this standard.

# Proposed Parameter Enactment Mode

In general when interacting with a ventilator a single PIRCS expression represents asserting a single parameter value.
However a ventilator in operation must seamlessly affect such changes (for example, after the completion of the current breath.)
A clinician may in fact want to change several parameters simultaneously, and not change one until all can be changed.
This could be accomplished by allowing a set of PIRCS control expressions to be grouped (easily done as a JSON array.)

However, another way to do this is is to enter an "accumulation moded" with PIRCS command, which would then be "enacted"
at the end of a breath cycle after giving  an "enact" command.

Both approaches have advantages. In a future versions of this protocol we will implement one or both.
