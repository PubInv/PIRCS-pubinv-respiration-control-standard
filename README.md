# The Public Invention Respiration Control Standard (PIRCS)
A parallel standard to the closely related [Public Invention Respriation Data Standard](https://github.com/PubInv/respiration-data-standard), this is a control standard for controlling air drives for COVID-19 pandemic ventilators.

At the moment, this standard is a very early draft as a [markedown file](https://github.com/PubInv/pubinv-respiration-control-standard/blob/master/PIRCS.md).
